          <h5>Mercedes-Benz</h5>
          <p>
            Mercedes-Benz (German: [mɛɐ̯ˈtseːdəsˌbɛnts, -dɛs-]),[6][7] commonly
            referred to as Mercedes, is a German automotive luxury brand (and
            subsidiary – as Mercedes-Benz AG – of Daimler AG) headquartered in
            Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, Germany.[1] Mercedes-Benz produces
            luxury vehicles and commercial vehicles.[note 2] The first
            Mercedes-Benz brand name vehicles were produced in 1926. In 2018,
            Mercedes-Benz was the largest seller of premium vehicles in the
            world, having sold 2.31 million passenger cars.[8] The company's
            origins come from Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft's 1901 Mercedes and
            Karl Benz's 1886 Benz Patent-Motorwagen, which is widely regarded as
            the first internal combustion engine in a self-propelled automobile.
            The fuel was not gasoline, but rather a much more volatile petroleum
            spirit called ligroin. The slogan for the brand is "the best or
            nothing".[9]
